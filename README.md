Wilde Amor Landing Page Redesign – Key Improvements
In the redesign of Wilde Amor’s landing page, I focused on improving usability, visual clarity, and creating a sleek, modern user experience. Here’s a concise breakdown of the core updates:
1. Enhanced Search Bar and Icons
The search icon was enlarged to improve visibility and ease of use. I also refined the profile, wishlist, and shopping bag icons so they stand out more clearly, allowing for quicker access to key features.
2. Added Product Categories
To streamline product discovery, I introduced clear category tabs for Men, Women, and Kids in the main navigation. This helps users quickly filter and browse products based on their interests, enhancing overall shopping efficiency.
3. Improved Color Scheme
I switched the background color to black to create a bold, high-contrast look. This not only adds a premium feel but also improves text readability and makes product images stand out more effectively.
4. Reorganized and Expanded Footer
The footer layout was cleaned up and made more informative. I added extra social media links to strengthen brand presence and encourage user engagement. This makes it easier for users to connect with Wilde Amor across platforms.
These updates bring a fresh, modern aesthetic to the site while making it significantly easier to navigate, shop, and interact with the brand.
